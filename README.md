### ðŸ”¥ We release the code of CTRL, the first open-sourced LiDAR-based auto-labeling system. See [ctrl_instruction](https://github.com/tusen-ai/SST/blob/main/docs/CTRL_instructions.md).
### ðŸ”¥ We release FSDv2. Better performance, easier use! Support Waymo, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2. See [fsdv2_instruction](https://github.com/tusen-ai/SST/blob/main/docs/fsdv2_instructions.md).
