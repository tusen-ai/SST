This is the official implementation of paper:

[Fully Sparse 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10035) 
and
[Embracing Single Stride 3D Object Detector with Sparse Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.06375.pdf).

**ðŸ”¥FSD Pre-release**
- Code of SpConv-based FSD on Waymo is released. See `./configs/fsd/fsd_waymoD1_1x.py`
- We provide the tools for processing Argoverse 2 dataset in `./tools/argo`. We will release the instruction and configs of Argo2 model later.
- A very fast Waymo evaluation, see Usage section for detailed instructions. The whole evaluation process of FSD on Waymo costs less than **10min** with 8 2080Ti GPUs.
- We cannot distribute model weights of FSD on Waymo due to the license. Users could contact us for the private model weights.
- Before using this repo, please install [TorchEx](https://github.com/Abyssaledge/TorchEx) and SpConv2 (SpConv 1.x is not supported).

**NEWS**
- [22-09-15] ðŸ”¥ FSD is accepted at NeurIPS 2022.
- [22-06-06] Support SST with CenterHead, cosine similarity in attention, faster SSTInputLayer. See Usage for details.
- ðŸ”¥ SST is accepted at CVPR 2022.
- Support Weighted NMS (CPU version) in [RangeDet](https://github.com/TuSimple/RangeDet), improving performance of vehicle class by ~1 AP.
See `Usage` section.
- We refactored the code to provide more clear function prototypes and a better understanding. See `./configs/sst_refactor`
- Supported voxel-based region partition in `./configs/sst_refactor`. Users can easily use voxel-based SST by modifying the `recover_bev` function in the backbone.
- Waymo Leaderboard results updated in [SST_v1](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/entry/?challenge=DETECTION_3D&emailId=5854f8ae-6285&timestamp=1640329826551565)

## Introduction
- SST is a **single-stride** network, which maintains original feature resolution from the beginning to the end of the network. Due to the characterisric of single stride, SST achieves exciting performances on small object detection (Pedestrian, Cyclist).

## Usage
**PyTorch >= 1.9 is recommended for a better support of the checkpoint technique.**

Our implementation is based on [MMDetection3D](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d), so just follow their [getting_started](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md) and simply run the script: `run.sh`.

### Fast Waymo Evaluation:
- Copy `tools/idx2timestamp.pkl` and `tools/idx2contextname.pkl` to `./data/waymo/kitti_format/`.
- Passing the arguement `--eval fast` (See `run.sh`). This arguement will directly convert network outputs to Waymo `.bin` format, which is much faster than the old waymo.
- Users could further build the multi-thread waymo evaluation tool (link)[https://github.com/Abyssaledge/waymo-open-dataset-master] for faster evaluation. 

### For SST:
We only provide the single-stage model here, as for our two-stage models, please follow [LiDAR-RCNN](https://github.com/TuSimple/LiDAR_RCNN). It's also a good choice to apply other powerful second stage detectors to our single-stage SST.

We borrow **Weighted NMS** from RangeDet and observe ~1 AP improvement on our best Vehicle model. To use it, you are supposed to clone [RangeDet](https://github.com/TuSimple/RangeDet), and simply run `pip install -v -e .` in its root directory. Then refer to `config/sst/sst_waymoD5_1x_car_8heads_wnms.py` to modify your config and enable Weight NMS. Note we only implement the CPU version for now, so it is relatively slow. Do NOT use it on 3-class models, which will lead to performance drop.

A basic config of SST with CenterHead: `./configs/sst_refactor/sst_waymoD5_1x_3class_centerhead.py`, which has significant improvement in Vehicle class.
To enable faster SSTInputLayer, clone https://github.com/Abyssaledge/TorchEx, and run `pip install -v .`.


## Main results

**_All the results of single stage models are reproducible with this repo. We also find that some improvements can usually be obtained by replacing your pillar-based conv backbone with SST.
So please let us know if you have trouble reproducing the results. Discussions are definitely welcome if you could not obtain satisfactory performances with SST in your projects._**

Note that we train the 3 classes together, so the performance above is a little bit lower than that reported in our paper.
